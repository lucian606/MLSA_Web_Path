# Lab 04: React Basics

## Create a basic forum web application (like Reddit) using React. The app should have the following functionalities:
### 1. As a user I would like to be able to create a new post with a custom title and description.
#### Hint: You can either create a modal which asks for user input or you can redirect the user to a separate page which containts the form that creates a new post.
#### Hint: Since we don't have access to a database, we can store the posts in memory, by using arrays/lists/etc...
### 2. As a user I would like to be able to view other posts that were created.
#### Hint: For the post page you can either use states to switch posts or you can use route parameters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VmF4WsLCo&ab_channel=TheNetNinja
### 3. As a user I would like to be able to leave a comment on a post.
### 4. As a user I would like to be able to delete comments and posts.
#### Hint: Everyone can delete every post or comment, we don't have to worry about authentication...yet
